# Data Scientist Portfolio Projects
------
### I was always so interested in coding, which made me realise that I should take that path to make myself feel comfortable. 
That made me decided to become a Data Scientist. So I started working for it. 
This is the place where I keep all my projects, which helped me to become a Data Scientist.
